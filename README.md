# hello-world
my first GIT practice
this is the beggining of my coding journey, 2 years from now I will look back at this and laugh at how little I knew and how much I have gained over the 2 years. The lord will continue to bless me and my family in anyway he can and I will be grateful for it all. Thanks for helping me reach my goal of becoming a full stack web developer.
